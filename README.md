# World_Weather_Analysis

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is create a searchable database of cities to be used to assist customers in finding a suitable vacation destination based on desired temperatures. 

This is achieved by: 

- Generating a list of numbers to be used at latitude and longitudes
- Converting those numbers into city data. 
- Using the Open Weather Map API to get weather information on said cities.
- Take user input of their desired temperature range.  
- Using the Google Maps API to map these points on a map. 

See below for examples of these maps in action.
